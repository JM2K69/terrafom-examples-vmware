## Getting Started

If you'd like to automate the creation of the custom vSphere role, a Terraform example is included in the project.

1. Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/tenthirtyam/terraform-examples-vmware.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory for the example.

```
cd terraform-examples-vmware/vsphere/vsphere-roles-vrealize
```

3. Duplicate the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars` in the directory.

```
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

4. Open the `terraform.tfvars` file and update the variables according to your environment.

5. Initialize the current directory and the required Terraform provider for VMware vSphere.

```
terraform init
```

6. Create a Terraform plan and save the output to a file.

```
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

6. Apply the Terraform plan.

```
terraform apply tfplan
```
